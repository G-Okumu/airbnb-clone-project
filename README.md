## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Deliver a **clean and intuitive interface** that makes it easy for users to browse and book properties.
- Ensure **responsive design** across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Create a **consistent visual hierarchy** and user flow from property discovery to booking confirmation.
- Focus on **accessibility** and usability standards to improve user experience for all users.


### Key Features to Implement

- Property browsing with images, filters, and categories.
- Detailed property information with reviews and host contact info.
- Seamless checkout process with confirmation feedback.
- Navigation system that supports smooth transitions and back-navigation.
- Mobile-first design approach.

### Primary Pages Overview

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Page Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Property Listing View</strong></td>
      <td>Displays a searchable and filterable grid/list of available properties. Includes property name, thumbnail, price, and rating.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Listing Detailed View</strong></td>
      <td>Shows expanded details of a selected property, including a full image gallery, amenities, location map, availability, and reviews.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Simple Checkout View</strong></td>
      <td>Provides a minimal interface to review booking summary, enter user details, choose payment method, and confirm reservation.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

<p>In a booking system, the user interface directly affects trust and conversion. A user-friendly design:</p>

- Reduces confusion and abandonment during booking.
- Builds confidence in the legitimacy and professionalism of the platform.
- Enhances user satisfaction, which increases repeat usage and positive referrals.
- Ensures accessibility for a broader audience, including users with disabilities or on slower networks.

### Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Clearly identifying the design properties of a mockup ensures consistency between the design and the actual implementation. It allows developers to:

- Accurately translate visual elements into code.
- Maintain brand alignment and cohesive UI across all screens.
- Save time during development by reducing ambiguity.
- Enhance accessibility by using appropriate text sizes, colors, and contrast.
- Create a scalable and reusable design system for future updates.
