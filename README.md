- Reduces confusion and abandonment during booking.
- Builds confidence in the legitimacy and professionalism of the platform.
- Enhances user satisfaction, which increases repeat usage and positive referrals.
- Ensures accessibility for a broader audience, including users with disabilities or on slower networks.

### Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Clearly identifying the design properties of a mockup ensures consistency between the design and the actual implementation. It allows developers to:

- Accurately translate visual elements into code.
- Maintain brand alignment and cohesive UI across all screens.
- Save time during development by reducing ambiguity.
- Enhance accessibility by using appropriate text sizes, colors, and contrast.
- Create a scalable and reusable design system for future updates.
